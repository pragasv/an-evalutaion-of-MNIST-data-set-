from FC layers to CNN 

We'll first build a simple neural network consisting of two fully connected layers and apply this to the digit classification task. Our network will ultimately output a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes (0-9). This first architecture we will be building is depicted below:

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly well-suited for a variety of tasks in computer vision, and have achieved near-perfect accuracies on the MNIST dataset. We will now build a CNN composed of two convolutional layers and pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers, and ultimately output a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes (0-9). The CNN we will be building is depicted below:
